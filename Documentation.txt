In general each track widget has the following setup:


## Creation:
        self.partitionsTrackWidget = TimelineTrackDrawingWidget_Partition(-1, None, [], self.totalStartTime, self.totalEndTime)

## Layout:
        self.extendedTracksContainerVboxLayout.addWidget(self.partitionsTrackWidget)
        self.partitionsTrackWidget.setMinimumSize(500,50)
        self.partitionsTrackWidget.setSizePolicy(QtWidgets.QSizePolicy.Expanding, QtWidgets.QSizePolicy.Expanding)




GENERAL TODO:
 - "Comments" Track: multiline comments previewed in timeline, with popover text display and editor.
    - Perhaps preview of text of hovered comments in another pane or the status bar.
    - Perhaps allowing user color coding or short text to be displayed on the comment itself.
    - Perhaps support for instantaneous, duration, or file comments.

- "Video" Track: displays videos along a full timeline.
    - Perhaps multiple video tracks allowed, one for original source videos and another for DeepLabCut processed videos for example.

- Need to be able to adjust "zoom".
